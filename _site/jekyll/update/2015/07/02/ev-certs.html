    <p class="post-meta">Jul 2, 2015</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Since standing up this blog, one of my earlier priorities was to <a href="https://mads.ninja/nginx/server/ssl/https/2015/06/25/nginx-config.html">get an SSL certificate</a> so I could leverage (and force) HTTPS. It’s not as though my site actually has anything which would <em>need</em> to be encrypted, but I think it’s a good practice. I was able to procure a certificate through my registrar, and it was honestly <em>very</em> cheap at only $10 USD. The downside of such a certificate, of course, is that it’s not nearly as effective from a consumer trust standpoint. It’s the type of certificate that a Certificate Authority will give to just about anyone. All I had to do was generate a CSR from my server and fork over ten bucks; literally <em>anyone</em> can do that.</p>

<p>The tradeoff is that most browsers won’t make much of a deal out of it. Chrome honestly does it the most justice by at least making the lock icon in the address bar green:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/chrome_lock.png" alt="Chrome lock icon" /></p>

<p>When looking at the same icon in Firefox or even Internet Explorer it shows up as a bland, gray icon. While the lock is still there, it doesn’t have a nice green glow indicating that things should be considered safe. For most browsers, if I want that kind of feedback for users I’d need an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate">Extended Validation</a> or EV certificate. While it’s functionally the same as my cheaper certificate from a technical perspective, the difference is the process used before handing it out. While my certificate required very little in the way of information about me, an EV certificate has a more rigorous process surrounding it. I figured I may be willing to go through that process just to give my site an even more professional look, so I decided to check what an EV certificate would run me from the same provider from which I got my current cert:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2015/comodo_ev_cert.png" alt="Comodo EV cert price" /></p>

<p>Suffice to say, one look at the price <em>immediately</em> killed any plans of mine for procuring an EV cert. While I like the idea of allowing/forcing an encrypted connection to my site for no better reason than “Why not? Everyone should do it.”, I’m not quite concerned enough with giving everyone a pretty, green URL bar that I’m willing to spend that kind of money on the endeavor. $10 USD a year for a certificate is perfectly reasonable. Paying $135 USD extra just to make the address bar green is a bit too much for me, though. I’ll be sticking with my existing certificate for the foreseeable future unless I randomly start doing e-commerce on my blog or something similarly insane.</p>
