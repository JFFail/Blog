My name is John. I work on the Messaging And Directory Services (MADS) team. I'm a full-time computer nerd working as a sysadmin. In the office I'm mainly involved in Windows-centric administration managing Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP. I also adminster Office 365 and work closely with SSO for SaaS applications back to Azure AD. Then I mess around a little bit with SaaS applications like Google Apps.

In my free time I focus heavily on FOSS and the Unix/Linux world. I started using Linux personally in 2006 and never looked back. I'm a huge fan of CLIs, and I firmly believe that Vim is the one true editor. After struggling to learn it, I can't believe how much slower I am now on any editor which relies on the arrow keys.

Outside of computers I have a wealth of other nerd-esque hobbies. I like writing (obviously), reading, and binging on Netflix. I'm also a fan of tattoos, and I'm usually plotting my next piece. Finally I also like getting in touch with my inner hipster by enjoying craft beer, bourbon (neat, always and only), and coffee.
