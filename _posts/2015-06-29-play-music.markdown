I was pretty geeked last week when I saw that [Google Play Music was getting free, ad-supported radio][droidlife]. I've been a huge fan of Play Music back when it first launched as "Google Music", and I've been a regular user ever since. Even before Google worked out deals with record lables so you could purchase music from them, it was a great repository for storing my music online so that I could stream it from any of my computers. Instead of having to keep tracks copied to the HDD for each machine I could just fire up a browser and stream my collection. Once you started being able to *buy* music from Google, I even turned to them for purchasing the occasional track or album if it was a better deal than Amazon... or if I happened to have Play Store credits.

Google also offers up the Spotify-esque ability to stream *any* track that you may want across their entire library. While I've leveraged that service before as well, I found that I didn't use it enough to warrant the $10 USD each month that it was running me; streaming Netflix is cheaper than that. While for the most part I like streaming music from my personal collection, I occasionally want to listen to something random that I *don't* own. Until last week, this meant that I had to keep another music app on my phone like Pandora or Songza.

Fortunately, now that's no longer the case. Firing up the updated app from my phone shows me something very familiar:

If you've ever used Songza before then you probably feel like you have a bit of deja vu since the interface looks very similar to this, with the same tiles asking you to pick what activity or mood you happen to be experiencing at the moment so they can find music to match it. It seemed like this was only the natural progression considering it's been about a year since [Google bought Songza][googlebuy]. I'm glad to see that the best pieces of Songza made it into Play Music while still being free to use for those who don't want to pay for them.

One oddity that I have noticed is that, while all of the information claims these stations are ad-supported, I have yet to hear a single advertisement while streaming them for the past week. Both from the web interface on a computer and the Play Music app on my phone and tablet I've listened to **hours** of music without a single advertisement... not that I'm complaining about it. :-)
